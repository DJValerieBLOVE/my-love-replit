PROMPT: Events, Love Board, Notes, Vault & Private Data Infrastructure

Read replit.md, EXPERIMENT_BUILDER_PLAN.md, and NOSTR_GUIDELINES.md fully before starting. This is a large prompt covering multiple feature areas that need to be built or fixed to work end-to-end. Work through them in order.

A. Events System (Full CRUD + RSVP):

Make the Events page (/events) fully functional end-to-end with real database CRUD
Event Create page (/event-create) should save events to the database with: title, description, date, time, location (virtual or physical), image, dimension (11 Dimensions dropdown with colored dots), recurring options
Event Detail page (/events/:id) should show full event info, RSVP button that saves to database, attendee count, share button
RSVP system: track RSVPs in database (create eventRsvps table if needed), show "Going" badge, attendee list
Events listing should show real data from database, with filter by dimension and upcoming/past tabs
Calendar view should work with real event dates
Check existing schema in shared/schema.ts for events table and update as needed
Check existing API routes in server/routes.ts and storage in server/storage.ts
B. Love Board / Marketplace (at /leaderboard route):

Make the Love Board fully functional for paid members
Categories: For Sale, Help Wanted, Services, Other
Full CRUD: create listings, edit own listings, delete own listings
Each listing has: title, description, category, price (optional), contact info, dimension tag, image
Check existing Love Board create page (/love-board-create) and listing page (/leaderboard)
Check existing schema and routes — the loveBoardPosts table may already exist
Membership gate should work (only paid members can post, everyone can browse)
Search and filter by category tabs
C. Notes System:

Build/verify a working Notes system accessible from the Vault page
Notes CRUD: create, read, update, delete personal notes
Notes should be stored in PostgreSQL with user ownership
Check if notes or similar table exists in schema, create if needed
Notes should have: title, content (rich text via TipTap editor), dimension tag (optional), created/updated timestamps
Notes list view and detail/edit view
D. Vault Page — Private Data Hub:

The Vault page (/vault) should be the central hub for all user's private data
Tabs or sections for: Daily LOVE Practice entries, Journal entries, Experiment progress, Notes, Saved content
Each section should pull REAL data from the database (not mock/placeholder)
Daily LOVE Practice entries should show actual saved practice data
Journal entries should show actual journal data
Experiment progress should show enrolled experiments with completion status
Notes section should show user's notes from the Notes system above
Add download/export functionality for user data (JSON export of all personal data)
E. Private Relay Data Sync (Foundation):

Read NOSTR_GUIDELINES.md for relay architecture rules
Ensure all personal data (journal entries, daily practice, notes, dreams) is NIP-44 encrypted when stored
Personal data should sync to the private Railway relay (wss://nostr-rs-relay-production-1569.up.railway.app)
This is the foundation for data portability — users should eventually be able to download and unlock their data anywhere
For now, focus on ensuring the encryption and private relay publish pipeline works for at least journal entries and daily practice data
Do NOT publish any personal data to public relays — only the private LaB relay
Design Rules (must follow):

Marcellus font, weight 400 ONLY
Primary: #6600ff, Background: #FAFAFA, Foreground: #2a2430
ALL icons: text-muted-foreground EXCEPT Sparkles (Magic Mentor AI only)
Colored dots next to 11 Dimension names in ALL dropdowns/filters
Cards: border-none shadow-sm bg-card rounded-xs with hover:shadow-md, 16:9 images, thin purple accent line at top
Tags/Badges: bg-white border border-gray-200 text-muted-foreground text-xs px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-md
Buttons: Primary bg-foreground text-background, Ghost hover hover:bg-[#F0E6FF]
Search Inputs: bg-white with Search icon at left-3 and pl-10
Create Buttons: Each listing page has a "Create" button in the tab/header row area
Key files: shared/schema.ts, server/routes.ts, server/storage.ts, client/src/lib/api.ts, client/src/pages/events.tsx, client/src/pages/event-detail.tsx, client/src/pages/event-create.tsx, client/src/pages/leaderboard.tsx, client/src/pages/love-board-create.tsx, client/src/pages/vault.tsx, client/src/pages/note.tsx, client/src/pages/journal.tsx, client/src/pages/daily-practice.tsx, client/src/lib/relays.ts, NOSTR_GUIDELINES.md

Important: Update replit.md and EXPERIMENT_BUILDER_PLAN.md when each section is complete. Make sure all changes are saved so they sync properly.

That covers Events, Love Board, Notes, Vault, and the private data foundation. After that prompt is done, the remaining experiment builder prompts from the plan would be:

Prompt 4: Lightning Zaps (Value-for-Value)
Prompt 5: Magic Mentor AI Setup
Prompt 6: Custom Tags System
