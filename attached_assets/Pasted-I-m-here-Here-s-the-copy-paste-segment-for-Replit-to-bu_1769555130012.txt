I'm here! Here's the copy-paste segment for Replit to build the Vault:

## 🔐 THE VAULT (User's Private Brain)

### Overview

The Vault is the user's private, encrypted space containing all their personal data. Think of it as their "second brain" — everything they need to track progress, reflect, and grow.

### Vault Tabs (4 Core Tabs)

| Tab | Icon | Purpose | Key Features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Daily LOVE Practice** | 💜 | Structured 5 V's ritual — morning start + evening Victory completion | ONE entry per day; Morning: set Vibe, Vision, Value, Villain; Evening: complete Victory (includes LaB — Lessons & Blessings); Tracks streaks; AI learns from this |
| **Journal** | 📓 | Free-form reflections with optional templates | Templates available: Blank, LaB Notes (Lesson + Blessing format), Gratitude, custom; Can tag entries with 11 Areas; AI learns from permitted entries |
| **Bookmarks** | 🔖 | Saved content from anywhere | Save Experiments, Tribe posts, external links; Organize by tags or folders |
| **Assessments** | 📊 | Quiz results and progress snapshots | 11x LOVE Code results stored here; Other assessments over time; Progress snapshots to track growth |

### Daily LOVE Practice Structure (5 V's)

The Daily LOVE Practice is ONE entry per day with TWO check-ins:

**☀️ MORNING (User starts their day):**

1. **Vibe** — How do I want to FEEL today?
2. **Vision** — What does my ideal day look like?
3. **Value** — What will I create/contribute today?
4. **Villain** — What's trying to stop me? (CLADDD: Confusion, Lies, Apathy, Disconnection, Distraction, Drifting)

**🌙 EVENING (User completes their day):**

1. **Victory** — What actually happened? This includes:
    - Did I stay in my Vibe?
    - What was my actual Victory today?
    - **LaB (Lessons & Blessings)** — What did I learn? What am I grateful for?

**Key Implementation Notes:**

- Morning and Evening are on the SAME entry (not separate entries)
- Victory section is filled in at end of day
- LaB is embedded within Victory, not a separate tab
- Streak tracking: counts days user completes both morning AND evening
- Login tracking: user should be in app twice daily (AM + PM)

### Big Dreams (11x LOVE Code Output)

**Big Dreams is NOT a Vault tab** — it's already in the sidebar as its own section.

**Flow:**

1. User takes **11x LOVE Code** assessment (in Assessments tab)
2. Results generate their **Big Dreams** — 11 dreams for the 11 life areas
3. Big Dreams appear in the sidebar and become **AI training data**
4. AI references Big Dreams when coaching the user

**The 11 Areas:**

1. God/Spirituality
2. Mission/Purpose
3. Body
4. Mind
5. Soul
6. Romance
7. Family
8. Community
9. Money
10. Time
11. Environment

### Tags System (Cross-Cutting)

Users can tag ANY entry in Journal or Daily LOVE Practice with:

- **11 Areas tags** (Health, Wealth, Relationships, etc.)
- This allows filtering: "Show me everything related to my Money journey"
- Tags are OPTIONAL — casual users don't need them, power users love them

### AI Integration

The AI Magic Mentor learns from:

- ✅ Daily LOVE Practice entries (with permission)
- ✅ Journal entries (with permission)
- ✅ Big Dreams (11x LOVE Code results)
- ✅ Assessment history
- ❌ Bookmarks (just links, no content to learn from)

User controls what AI can access in Settings → AI Data Access.

### Data Storage

All Vault data follows the privacy architecture:

- **Encrypted with user's Nostr key** before saving
- **Stored in browser IndexedDB** (primary)
- **Backed up to Nostr relays** (encrypted)
- **Fallback to database** (still encrypted — you can't read it)
