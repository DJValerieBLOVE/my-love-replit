You are the world's best full-stack developer and product architect. I want to build a SaaS platform for desktop (web) and mobile (iOS/Android) that serves course creators, coaches, and community leaders.

This platform must combine ALL the best features from these three platforms:

1. [**Circle.so**](http://Circle.so) — Community spaces, course hosting, member directory, events, gamification
2. **Mighty Networks** — Courses, community, native mobile apps, member profiles, activity feeds
3. [**Primal.net**](http://Primal.net) — Nostr protocol, Bitcoin Lightning zaps, privacy-first social, decentralized identity

You decide the tech stack, architecture, and implementation details. I'll describe what I want it to do and how it should feel.
